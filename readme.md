Steps to run locally
Step 1: Clone the Extension Repository

Instead of downloading the extension build from a provided link, you can clone the extension repository directly from GitHub. Follow these steps:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the extension repository.
Run the following command to clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Adebayo27/email-manager-chrome-extension

Step 2: Access Chrome Extensions Settings
Open your Google Chrome browser and click on the three vertical dots in the top-right corner to access the Chrome menu. From the menu, select “Settings.”

Step 3: Navigate to Extensions
In the Chrome settings, scroll down and click on the “Extensions” option located in the left-hand sidebar. Alternatively, you can directly enter the following URL in the address bar: chrome://extensions/

Step 4: Enable Developer Mode
Once you are on the Extensions page, toggle on the “Developer mode” switch located in the top-right corner. This will enable advanced options for testing and loading unpacked extensions.

Step 5: Load the Unpacked Extension
After enabling Developer mode, three new buttons will appear at the top of the Extensions page. Click on the “LOAD UNPACKED” button.

Step 6: Select the Unzipped Extension Folder
A file browser window will open. Navigate to the project folder of the extension that you downloaded in Step 1. Select the folder and click “OK” or “Open” to proceed.

Step 7: Verify Successful Upload
Once the folder is selected, Chrome will load the extension, and you will see it listed among your installed extensions. Look for the icon of the extension, usually displayed as a puzzle piece, in the Chrome toolbar.

Step 8: Pin the Extension (Optional)
To easily access the extension while testing, you can pin it to the Chrome toolbar. Right-click on the extension’s icon and select the “Pin” option from the context menu. This will keep the extension icon visible even when you close and reopen Chrome.

Step 9: Start Using the Extension Locally
Congratulations! You have successfully uploaded and loaded the extension locally. You can now start using the extension’s functionalities and test its features within your Chrome browser.
